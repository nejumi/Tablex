# 0122 Verification Log

This file records evidence for `docs/exec-plans/0122_audit_response_directive.md`.

Evidence grades:

- U: unit or integration test
- A: API-level verification
- B: browser/UI evidence
- L: live project evidence

## J1 Evaluation Contract Loop

Status: first implementation slice complete.

Implemented:

- Added `tablex_evaluation_request.v1` workspace request handling for:
  - `propose_evaluation`
  - `generate_split`
- Added `.tablex/requests/evaluation/` and `.tablex/acks/evaluation/` to prepared agent workspaces.
- Added evaluation request protocol details to session context and `.tablex/PROTOCOL.md`.
- `propose_evaluation` now validates fixed-format fields, referenced columns, metric names, and split-policy enum values, then registers an `EvaluationCandidate` and proposal artifact.
- `generate_split` now queues the existing split-manifest worker job for approved specs.
- Leaderboard API now returns `evaluation_grade` and `evaluation_grade_reason`.
- Leaderboard UI now labels rows as formal comparison or provisional internal validation.

Verification:

- U/A: `.venv/bin/pytest apps/backend/tests/test_agent_evaluation_requests.py apps/backend/tests/test_evaluation_splits.py -q`
  - Result: `5 passed, 1 warning`
- U: `npm run build` in `apps/frontend`
  - Result: passed
- U: `git diff --check`
  - Result: passed

Known remaining J1 evidence/work:

- B: browser evidence for provisional/formal leaderboard labeling is still pending.
- L: live flow from Chat/Console instruction to proposal, approval, split generation, and formal rerun is still pending.
- Full directive coverage for `time`, `fold_column`, and `fixed_file` proposal paths still needs targeted tests. The first slice covers candidate creation and generated group split execution.
